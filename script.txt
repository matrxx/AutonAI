start project: I want to build a simple website designed for kids which is a website oriented around 3D objects using three.js. So the main page will be an index well designed with some animations with 3 environnements to select, the 1st one will be a redirect to our 1st 3D environnement which is the solar system represented so all the planets with textures, stars around etc, the second one will be an ocean with fishes, sharks and other stuff that u can found in the ocean and for the third one I let you choose. So to resume: index with the link to the 3D environnements (the index has to be well designed), 1st environnement will be the solar system, second one is the ocean and you choose the third one. Those environnements should be 3D with three.js and texturized.
